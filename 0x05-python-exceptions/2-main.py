Errors and Exceptions
Learn to Program 11 Static & Exception Handling (starting at minute 7)
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
Why Python programming is awesome
What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
What are exceptions and how to use them
When do we need to use exceptions
How to correctly handle an exception
What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
How to raise a builtin exception
When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Tasks
0. Safe list printing
mandatory
Write a function that prints x elements of a list.

Prototype: def safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0):
my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
All elements must be printed on the same line followed by a new line.
x represents the number of elements to print
x can be bigger than the length of my_list
Returns the real number of elements printed
You have to use try: / except:
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use len()
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x05$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
safe_print_list = __import__('0-safe_print_list').safe_print_list

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

nb_print = safe_print_list(my_list, 2)
print("nb_print: {:d}".format(nb_print))
nb_print = safe_print_list(my_list, len(my_list))
print("nb_print: {:d}".format(nb_print))
nb_print = safe_print_list(my_list, len(my_list) + 2)
print("nb_print: {:d}".format(nb_print))

1. Safe printing of an integers list
mandatory
Write a function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().

Prototype: def safe_print_integer(value):
value can be any type (integer, string, etc.)
The integer should be printed followed by a new line
Returns True if value has been correctly printed (it means the value is an integer)
Otherwise, returns False
You have to use try: / except:
You have to use "{:d}".format() to print as integer
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use type()
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x05$ cat 1-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
safe_print_integer = __import__('1-safe_print_integer').safe_print_integer

value = 89
has_been_print = safe_print_integer(value)
if not has_been_print:
    print("{} is not an integer".format(value))

value = -89
has_been_print = safe_print_integer(value)
if not has_been_print:
    print("{} is not an integer".format(value))

value = "School"
has_been_print = safe_print_integer(value)
if not has_been_print:
    print("{} is not an integer".format(value))

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x05$ ./1-main.py

2. Print and count integers
mandatory
Write a function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.

Prototype: def safe_print_list_integers(my_list=[], x=0):
my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
All integers have to be printed on the same line followed by a new line - other type of value in the list must be skipped (in silence).
x represents the number of elements to access in my_list
x can be bigger than the length of my_list - if it’s the case, an exception is expected to occur
Returns the real number of integers printed
You have to use try: / except:
You have to use "{:d}".format() to print an integer
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use len()
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x05$ cat 2-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
safe_print_list_integers = \
    __import__('2-safe_print_list_integers').safe_print_list_integers

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

nb_print = safe_print_list_integers(my_list, 2)
print("nb_print: {:d}".format(nb_print))

my_list = [1, 2, 3, "School", 4, 5, [1, 2, 3]]
nb_print = safe_print_list_integers(my_list, len(my_list))
print("nb_print: {:d}".format(nb_print))

nb_print = safe_print_list_integers(my_list, len(my_list) + 2)
print("nb_print: {:d}".format(nb_print))
